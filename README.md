# HARK
Youth and adolescents in Tijuana aware of their HIV or AIDS diagnosis need motivation and communal support to foster consistent medicinal compliance because they are exposed to social stigma that restricts their education and awareness of their diagnosis, as well as prevents them from receiving life-saving treatment.

HARK is a group of 9 students at the University of California San Diego working with the nonprofit Es Por Los Ni√±os, based in Tijuana. This app aims to assist children with HIV/AIDS with regularly taking their medications, while increasing their awareness and understanding of their disease.
